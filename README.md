### Overview

This repo has been created by forked from (https://github.com/nogibjj/sqlite-lab). I have used world university ranking csv file and loaded it into 'ranking.db' database under the table name 'universities'.

Here is an overview of CRUD operations:
		
    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations for managing data in a database or data storage system. These operations are essential for interacting with and manipulating data within an application or database. Here's a brief overview of each CRUD operation:

1. **Create (C)**:
   - Create is the operation used to add new data or records to a database.
   - It typically involves inserting a new row or document into a database table or collection.
   - In SQL, you use the `INSERT INTO` statement to create new records in a table.
   - In NoSQL databases, you often use methods like `insertOne` or `insertMany` to add documents to a collection.

2. **Read (R)**:
   - Read is the operation used to retrieve data from a database.
   - It involves querying the database to fetch existing records based on specific criteria.
   - In SQL, you use the `SELECT` statement to read data from a table.
   - In NoSQL databases, you use various query methods to retrieve documents that match your criteria.

3. **Update (U)**:
   - Update is the operation used to modify existing data in a database.
   - It typically involves changing the values of one or more fields in an existing record.
   - In SQL, you use the `UPDATE` statement to update data in a table.
   - In NoSQL databases, you use methods like `updateOne` or `updateMany` to modify documents in a collection.

4. **Delete (D)**:
   - Delete is the operation used to remove data from a database.
   - It can involve deleting specific records or entire rows from a table.
   - In SQL, you use the `DELETE` statement to remove data from a table.
   - In NoSQL databases, you use methods like `deleteOne` or `deleteMany` to delete documents from a collection.

6.Created GitHub Actions that performs all four Makefile commands with badges for each one in the README.md

##### Action include the general CI/CD process in test.yml file, which automatically generate the graph and markdown
